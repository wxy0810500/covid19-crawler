from 2‑Aminobenzamides and Di-<i>tert</i>-butyl Dicarbonate	'The one-pot synthesis\nof quinazoline-2,4-diones was developed in\nthe presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) by metal-free catalysis.\nThe commercially available (Boc)<sub>2</sub>O acted as a key precursor\nin the construction of the 2-position carbonyl of quinazolinediones.\nThe <i>p</i>-methoxybenzyl (PMB)-activated heterocyclization\ncould smoothly proceed at room temperature instead of the microwave\ncondition. This strategy is compatible with a variety of substrates\nwith different functional groups. Furthermore, this protocol was utilized\nto smoothly prepare Zenarestat with a total yield of 70%.'	2020-04-16T21:43:51Z	10.1021/acsomega.0c01104.s001	https://figshare.com/articles/DMAP-Catalyzed_One-Pot_Synthesis_of_Quinazoline-2_4-diones_from_2_Aminobenzamides_and_Di-_i_tert_i_-butyl_Dicarbonate/12142173

Sulfur Vacancies of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> Nanosheets as a Binder-Free
Cathode for an Aqueous Rechargeable
Ni-Zn Battery	'The development of\nan efficient metal sulfide cathode is of great\nimportance and an ongoing challenge for the practical application\nof an aqueous rechargeable Ni-Zn battery. Herein, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> nanosheets with abundant sulfur vacancies (r-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>) have been successfully prepared via hydrothermal reaction\nand surface engineering, which are further employed as the binder-free\ncathode of the aqueous Ni-Zn battery. Benefitting from the features\nof substantially improved electrical conductivity, low band gap, abundant\nactive sites, and good intrinsic capacity, the r-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> electrode delivers an impressive reversible specific capacitance\n(1621.6 F g<sup>–1</sup> at 0.2 A g<sup>–1</sup>) and\nextraordinary rate capability (62.1% retention under 8 A g<sup>–1</sup>). Moreover, the aqueous rechargeable r-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>//Zn battery exhibits a remarkable specific capacity (240.8 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>–1</sup>) and preeminent cycling\ndurability (only 8.4% decay after 3000 cycles). Besides, a glorious\nenergy density of 419.6 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> together with a\npeak power density of 1.84 kW kg<sup>–1</sup> could be achieved,\nsurpassing a significant percentage of the reported Ni-Zn batteries.\nThe results reveal that the r-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> cathode\nwith abundant sulfur vacancies and the adopted facile approach possesses\nhuge promotion potential for Ni-Zn batteries and is promising to numerous\nelectronics and electric vehicle applications in the future.'	2020-04-16T19:37:09Z	10.1021/acsaem.0c00275.s001	https://figshare.com/articles/Engineering_Sulfur_Vacancies_of_Ni_sub_3_sub_S_sub_2_sub_Nanosheets_as_a_Binder-Free_Cathode_for_an_Aqueous_Rechargeable_Ni-Zn_Battery/12141261
2020-04-17	Cubic AgBiS<sub>2</sub> Colloidal Nanocrystals for
Solar Cells	'Recent progress in\ncolloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based solar cells\nindicates that low-toxicity materials such as AgBiS<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals\n(NCs) show potential in replacing toxic PbS and CdS CQDs in solar\ncell applications. In this study, an investigation on the importance\nof the composition and sensitivity toward synthesis conditions was\nperformed by adjusting concentrations and ratios of Ag and Bi precursors\ue5f8first,\nby varying the ratio of Ag toward Bi precursors and, second, by varying\nthe concentration of Ag with a constant ratio toward Bi precursors\nin the solution. Furthermore, elemental XPS studies and TEM imaging\ntogether with solar cell analysis indicated a strong correlation between\nthe concentration of Ag precursor and the NC properties and, moreover,\nthe solar cell properties based on these NCs. In short, a large amount\nof Ag precursor resulted in smaller Ag-rich NCs, which resulted in\nsolar cells with high photovoltage but low photocurrent density, while\na lower amount of Ag precursor resulted in larger NCs and solar cells\nwith a lower photovoltage. The Ag:Bi:S ratio of 0.72:0.9:1 resulted\nin almost stoichiometric NCs but with a slight excess of Ag, which\nin turn resulted in solar cells with the highest performance. This\nwork therefore gives insight into how the elemental composition and\nsize of the NCs can be tuned by the precursor ratios and how this,\nin turn, affects the performance of the solar cell devices.'	2020-04-16T19:03:23Z	10.1021/acsanm.9b02443.s001	https://figshare.com/articles/Cubic_AgBiS_sub_2_sub_Colloidal_Nanocrystals_for_Solar_Cells/12141195

Promotion on Coke Formation during
Propane Dehydrogenation over Pt/γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Catalysts	'The effect of boron\npromotion on the performance of 3 wt % Pt/γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts during propane dehydrogenation was\ninvestigated. A series of boron-promoted Pt/XB-γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts were synthesized, tested, and characterized.\nThe sequential impregnation of 1 wt % boron and 3 wt % platinum decreases\nthe amount of deposited carbon 3-fold, increases the propylene selectivity\nfrom 90% to 98%, and enhances the activity after 12 h by 40%. Catalyst\ncharacterization and thermodynamic DFT calculations suggest that boron\nforms a finely dispersed amorphous oxide on the γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> support and on the platinum particles, modifying both\nthe selectivity of the metal sites and the strength and number of\nacid sites on the support.'	2020-04-16T18:44:13Z	10.1021/acscatal.9b05548.s001	https://figshare.com/articles/Effect_of_Boron_Promotion_on_Coke_Formation_during_Propane_Dehydrogenation_over_Pt_-Al_sub_2_sub_O_sub_3_sub_Catalysts/12141162

for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Direct Synthesis via Surface-Bound
Ligands	'There\nis a critical need for sustainable routes to produce hydrogen\nperoxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A promising approach involves\ndirect synthesis from molecular hydrogen and oxygen at (sub)\xadambient\ntemperatures using unmodified supported Pd catalysts, which are limited\nby low selectivities. Controlling the environment of Pd active sites\nvia surface ligands is shown to enhance selectivity. Trends among\na myriad of surface ligands (i.e., phosphines, thiols, weakly bound\nmolecules) suggest that those containing H-bonding groups lead to\nthe highest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, potentially by\naffecting reaction energetics via H-bonding with key intermediates.\nThese insights lay the groundwork for ligand design to achieve the\noptimal catalyst performance for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis.'	2020-04-16T18:43:43Z	10.1021/acscatal.0c01517.s001	https://figshare.com/articles/Tunable_Catalytic_Performance_of_Palladium_Nanoparticles_for_H_sub_2_sub_O_sub_2_sub_Direct_Synthesis_via_Surface-Bound_Ligands/12141159

(Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>) and Carbon
Nanotube Hybrid-Supported Platinum
Catalysts for the High-Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction in PEMFC	'The metal–support\ninteraction offers electronic, compositional,\nand geometric effects that could enhance catalytic activity and stability.\nHerein, a high corrosion resistance and an excellent electrical conductivity\nMXene (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>)\nhybrid with a carbon nanotube (CNT) composite material is developed\nas a support for Pt. Such a composite catalyst enhances durability\nand improved oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to the commercial\nPt/C catalyst. The mass activity of Pt/CNT-MXene demonstrates a 3.4-fold\nimprovement over that of Pt/C. The electrochemical surface area of\nPt/CNT–Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> (1:1) catalysts shows only 6% drop with respect to that in Pt/C\nof 27% after 2000 cycle potential sweeping. Furthermore, the Pt/CNT–Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> (1:1) is used\nas a cathode catalyst for single cell and stack, and the maximum power\ndensity of the stack reaches 138 W. The structure distortion of the\nPt cluster induced by MXene is disadvantageous to the desorption of\nO atoms. This issue can be solved by adding CNT on MXene to stabilize\nthe Pt cluster. These remarkable catalytic performances could be attributed\nto the synergistic effect between Pt and CNT–Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>.'	2020-04-16T18:34:04Z	10.1021/acsami.0c02446.s001	https://figshare.com/articles/MXene_Ti_sub_3_sub_C_sub_2_sub_T_sub_i_x_i_sub_and_Carbon_Nanotube_Hybrid-Supported_Platinum_Catalysts_for_the_High-Performance_Oxygen_Reduction_Reaction_in_PEMFC/12141081
