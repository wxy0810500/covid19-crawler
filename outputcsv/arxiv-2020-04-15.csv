2020-04-15	'Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for COVID-19 Infection Detection and\n  Classification from CT Images'	'  An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded\nin Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic\naround the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also\nbe fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in\nAlgeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness\nmay result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and\nprogressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using\nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden\nstandard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.\nMoreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources\nmay also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such\ncircumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis\nand prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly\nsupervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19\ninfection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of\nmanual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection\ndetection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the\npromising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a\nwide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.\n'	2020-04-14T17:45:03Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06689v1
2020-04-15	'An automatic COVID-19 CT segmentation based on U-Net with attention\n  mechanism'	'  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led a devastating effect on\nthe global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the\nscreening of COVID-19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately\nsegment COVID-19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this\npaper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism.\nAs not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for\nsegmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism to a U-Net\narchitecture to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature\nrepresentations. In addition, the focal tversky loss is introduced to deal with\nsmall lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a small dataset\nwhere only 100 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can\nachieve an accurate and rapid segmentation on COVID-19 segmentation. The\nobtained Dice Score, Sensitivity and Specificity are 69.1%, 81.1%, and 97.2%,\nrespectively.\n'	2020-04-14T17:21:11Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06673v1
2020-04-15	'Abrupt declines in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide over China after the\n  outbreak of COVID-19'	"  China's policy interventions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease\n2019 have environmental and economic impacts. Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide\nindicates economic activities, as nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from\nfossil fuel consumption. Satellite measurements show a 48% drop in tropospheric\nnitrogen dioxide vertical column densities from the 20 days averaged before the\n2020 Lunar New Year to the 20 days averaged after. This is 20% larger than that\nfrom recent years. We relate to this reduction to two of the government's\nactions: the announcement of the first report in each province and the date of\na province's lockdown. Both actions are associated with nearly the same\nmagnitude of reductions. Our analysis offers insights into the unintended\nenvironmental and economic consequences through reduced economic activities.\n"	2020-04-14T14:20:31Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06542v1
2020-04-15	'CoroNet: A Deep Neural Network for Detection and Diagnosis of Covid-19\n  from Chest X-ray Images'	'  The novel Coronavirus also called Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, China in\nDecember 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected\naround 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114698 lives overall. As\nthe number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing\nshortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits\nand increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep\nLearning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting Covid-19\ncases using chest X-rays. Therefore, in this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep\nConvolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect Covid-19 infection\nfrom chest X-ray images. The deep model called CoroNet has been trained and\ntested on a dataset prepared by collecting Covid-19 and other chest pneumonia\nX-ray images from two different publically available databases. The\nexperimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy\nof 89.5%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for Covid-19 cases\nare 97% and 100%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which\ncan be further improved as more training data becomes available. Overall, the\nproposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology\nand during Covid-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical\npractitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and\nfollow-up of Covid-19 cases.\n'	2020-04-14T13:48:04Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04931v2
2020-04-15	'Molecular docking and binding mode analysis of selected FDA approved\n  drugs against COVID-19 selected key protein targets: An effort towards drug\n  repurposing to identify the combination therapy to combat COVID-19'	'  The emergence of COVID-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral\nand antibiotic drugs. Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure\nrate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of\nnew molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing\nalso called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a\nnew application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the\ncurrent pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA\napproved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative\nviral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many\nexisting viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and\nlikely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key\nproteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry\ninto the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n(RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion\nfrom immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine\n(HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to\ncombat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the\nbinding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues\nplaying a key role in their mechanism of action. The docking studies were\ncarried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server. Further\nstudies on a broad range of FDA approved drugs including few more protein\ntargets, molecular dynamics studies, in-vitro and in-vivo biological evaluation\nare required to identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of\nthe viral life cycle.\n'	2020-04-14T12:31:13Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06447v1
2020-04-15	'A simulation of a COVID-19 epidemic based on a deterministic SEIR model'	'  An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy\nwith a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the\ninfected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may\nideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the\nepidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous\ncase study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the\ndifferent parameters, mainly the variation of the degree of home isolation and\nsocial distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed\nindividuals and infected people and the infection, recovery and fatality rates.\nFirst, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the\nparameters and initial conditions. Then, we consider the Lombardy case and\ncalibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 14,\n2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the\nliterature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1), when there is a rapid\ndecrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 2.80 initially, 1.95 at day 22 and\n0.97 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The number of\nfatalities amounts to approximately 12000 at the end of the epidemic. The\nincubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 5.2 days\nand the infection period is 3.7 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00053/day\n[values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The case\nfatality rate (CFR) is 0.2 % (0.45 % if twice the reported number of casualties\nis assumed). If we use a wider range for the constraints, we obtain ca. 13 days\nand 5.53 days for the incubation and recovery periods, respectively, and a\nhigher CFR, ca. 0.6 %. These values become ca. 9 days, 7.6 days and 1.2 %\nassuming two times more casualties.\n'	2020-04-14T09:17:58Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03575v4
2020-04-15	'Sense and Sensibility: Characterizing Social Media Users Regarding the\n  Use of Controversial Terms for COVID-19'	'  With the world-wide development of 2019 novel coronavirus, although WHO has\nofficially announced the disease as COVID-19, one controversial term - "Chinese\nVirus" is still being used by a great number of people. In the meantime, global\nonline media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily,\nmost of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes\nincreasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media\nplatforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two\nways: using controversial terms like "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus", or using\nnon-controversial terms like "Coronavirus". In this study, we attempt to\ncharacterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use\nnon-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related\ntweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences\nbetween these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level\nfeatures like the number of followers, political following status, as well as\ntheir geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict\nTwitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to\ncharacterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a\nmajor crisis.\n'	2020-04-14T05:27:55Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06307v1
2020-04-15	'Group Testing for COVID-19: How to Stop Worrying and Test More'	'  The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel corona virus has\nan exponential rate of infection. COVID-19 is particularly notorious as the\nonset of symptoms in infected patients are usually delayed and there exists a\nlarge number of asymptomatic carriers. In order to prevent overwhelming of\nmedical facilities and large fatality rate, early stage testing and diagnosis\nare key requirements. In this article, we discuss the methodologies from the\ngroup testing literature and its relevance to COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically,\nwe investigate the efficiency of group testing using polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) for COVID-19. Group testing is a method in which multiple samples are\npooled together in groups and fewer tests are performed tests on these groups\nto discern all the infected samples. We study the effect of dilution due to\npooling in group testing and show that group tests can perform well even in the\npresence of dilution effects. We present multiple group testing algorithms that\ncould reduce the number of tests performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze\nthe efficiency of these tests and provide insights on their practical\nrelevance. With the use of algorithms described here, test plans can be\ndeveloped that can enable testing centers to increase the number of diagnosis\nperformed without increasing the number of PCR tests. The codes for generating\ntest plans are available online at [1].\n'	2020-04-14T05:27:12Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06306v1
2020-04-15	'Modeling, state estimation, and optimal control for the US COVID-19\n  outbreak'	'  The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 disease have had an\nunprecedented spread and continue to cause a increasing number of fatalities\nworldwide. While vaccines are still under development, social distancing,\nextensive testing, and quarantine of confirmed infected subjects remain the\nmost effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a\nsignificant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel\noptimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak\nin the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations,\nestimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal\ncontrol strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that\nthe number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive\ncomputational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most\neffective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected\nsubjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that "on-off" policies\nalternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can\nbe effective at "flattening" the curve while likely minimizing social and\neconomic cost.\n'	2020-04-14T03:44:11Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06291v1
2020-04-15	'Using altmetrics for detecting impactful research in quasi-zero-day\n  time-windows: the case of COVID-19'	'  On December 31st 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country\nOffice was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan\nCity. The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on\nJanuary 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2\n(SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works\nhave appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very\nearly stages is challenging.In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for\ninvestigating: (i) which toos and frameworkds are mostly used for early\nscholarly communication; (ii) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify\npotential impactful research in tight (i.e. {\\em quasi-zero-day}) time-windows.\nA literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for\ngathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19\nappeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020\nto February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that\nrepresents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge\ngraph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with\naltmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional\ncitation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. This\nsuggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated\nwith aforementioned indicators. Additionally, we define a method that\nharmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact\nindicator.\n'	2020-04-13T20:04:41Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06179v1
2020-04-15	'Containment efficiency and control strategies for the Corona pandemic\n  costs'	'  The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with\nthe problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies and the\nneed to balance public health considerations with the economic costs of a\npersistent lockdown. We introduce a modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR\nmodel, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves dynamically in response\nto political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The\nmodel reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions\nand countries that surpassed the peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased\nfeedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index\nthat measures the efficiency of containment policies (the CEI index). CEI\nvalues for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the\ncontrolled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and\nsocio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic.\nCosts comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as\nwell as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict\nmeasures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies based on actual case\nnumbers lead to substantially higher total costs than strategies based on the\noverall history of the epidemic.\n'	2020-04-13T16:39:20Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00493v2
2020-04-15	'Tracking COVID-19 using online search'	"  Online search data is routinely used to monitor the nationwide prevalence of\ninfectious diseases, such as influenza. Previous work has focused on supervised\nlearning solutions, where ground truth information, in the form of historical\nsyndromic surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models.\nHowever, no sufficient data $-$in terms of validity, representativeness, and\ntime span$-$ exist to apply such approaches for monitoring the emerging\nCOVID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised solutions should be\nsought. Recent outcomes have shown that it is possible to transfer an online\nsearch based model for influenza-like illness from a source to a target country\nwithout using ground truth data for the target location. The transferred\nmodel's accuracy depends on identifying the correct search queries and\ncorresponding weights via a transfer learning methodology. In this work, we\ndraw a parallel to previous findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised\nmodel for COVID-19 by: (i) carefully choosing search queries that refer to\nrelated symptoms as identified by a survey from the National Health Service in\nthe United Kingdom, and (ii) weighting them based on their reported ratio of\noccurrence in people infected by COVID-19. Furthermore, understanding that\nonline searches can also be driven by concern rather than infections, we\nattempt to minimise this part of the signal by incorporating a basic news media\ncoverage metric. In addition, we propose a transfer learning method for mapping\nsupervised COVID-19 models from a country to another, in an effort to transfer\nnoisy knowledge from areas that are ahead in the epidemic curve. Finally, we\nconduct a correlation and regression analysis to uncover potentially useful\nonline search queries in relation to confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n"	2020-04-13T12:08:26Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08086v5
2020-04-15	'Low-Cost and High-Throughput Testing of COVID-19 Viruses and Antibodies\n  via Compressed Sensing: System Concepts and Computational Experiments'	"  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic infectious disease\noutbreak that has significantly harmed and threatened the health and lives of\nmillions or even billions of people. COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the\nsocial and economic activities of many countries significantly. With no\napproved vaccine available at this moment, extensive testing of COVID-19\nviruses in people are essential for disease diagnosis, virus spread\nconfinement, contact tracing, and determining right conditions for people to\nreturn to normal economic activities. Identifying people who have antibodies\nfor COVID-19 can also help select persons who are suitable for undertaking\ncertain essential activities or returning to workforce. However, the\nthroughputs of current testing technologies for COVID-19 viruses and antibodies\nare often quite limited, which are not sufficient for dealing with COVID-19\nviruses' anticipated fast oscillating waves of spread affecting a significant\nportion of the earth's population.\n  In this paper, we propose to use compressed sensing (group testing can be\nseen as a special case of compressed sensing when it is applied to COVID-19\ndetection) to achieve high-throughput rapid testing of COVID-19 viruses and\nantibodies, which can potentially provide tens or even more folds of speedup\ncompared with current testing technologies. The proposed compressed sensing\nsystem for high-throughput testing can utilize expander graph based compressed\nsensing matrices developed by us \\cite{Weiyuexpander2007}.\n"	2020-04-13T03:55:39Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05759v1
2020-04-15	'A time-dependent SEIR model to analyse the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2\n  epidemic outbreak in Portugal'	"  Background: The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is of paramount\nimportance to understand the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help\nhealth and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement\nsuitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A\ntime-dependent dynamic SIR model inspired in a model previously used during the\nMERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of\nactive and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the\nvirus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable\nparameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of\nabout 13,000 active cases is estimated somewhere around April. Hospitalized\ncases could reach a peak of about 2,300 cases, of which 500-750 in ICU units.\nConclusion: With appropriate measures, the number of active cases in Portugal\ncan be controlled at about 13,000 people, of which about 2,300 hospitalized and\n500-750 in ICU units. This seems manageable by the country's national health\nservice with an estimated 1,140 ventilators.\n"	2020-04-13T03:29:20Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04735v2
2020-04-15	'Estimation of time-varying transmission and removal rates underlying\n  epidemiological processes: a new statistical tool for the COVID-19 pandemic'	"  The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly evolved into an unprecedented crisis.\nThe susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model and its variants have been used\nfor modeling the pandemic. However, time-independent parameters in the\nclassical models may not capture the dynamic transmission and removal\nprocesses, governed by virus containment strategies taken at various phases of\nthe epidemic. Moreover, very few models account for possible inaccuracies of\nthe reported cases. We propose a Poisson model with time-dependent transmission\nand removal rates to account for possible random errors in reporting and\nestimate a time-dependent disease reproduction number, which may be used to\nassess the effectiveness of virus control strategies. We apply our method to\nstudy the pandemic in several severely impacted countries, and analyze and\nforecast the evolving spread of the coronavirus. We have developed an\ninteractive web application to facilitate readers' use of our method.\n"	2020-04-13T00:14:15Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05730v1
2020-04-15	'Towards an Efficient Deep Learning Model for COVID-19 Patterns Detection\n  in X-ray Images'	'  Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus, the\nSARS-CoV-2, is nowadays one of the most prominent challenges of the human\nspecies. A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is rapid diagnosis\nand isolation of infected patients. Nevertheless, the standard method for\nCOVID-19 identification, the RT-PCR, is time-consuming and in short supply due\nto the pandemic.\n  Researchers around the world have been trying to find alternative screening\nmethods. In this context, deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has\nbeen showing a lot of promise for the identification of COVID-19. Despite their\nsuccess, the computational cost of these methods remains high, which imposes\ndifficulties in their accessibility and availability. Thus, in this work, we\naddress the hypothesis that better performance in terms of overall accuracy and\nCOVID-19 sensitivity can be achieved with much more compact models. In order to\ntest this hypothesis, we propose a modification of the EfficientNet family of\nmodels. By doing this we were able to produce a high-quality model with an\noverall accuracy of 91.4%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 90% and positive prediction\nof 100% while having about 30 times fewer parameters than the baseline model,\n28 and 5 times fewer parameters than the popular VGG16 and ResNet50\narchitectures, respectively.\n'	2020-04-12T23:26:56Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05717v1

2020-04-15	'Residual Attention U-Net for Automated Multi-Class Segmentation of\n  COVID-19 Chest CT Images'	'  The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly\naround the world and caused significant impact on the public health and\neconomy. However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the\nlung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the\ndiagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate\nquantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT)\nimages. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated\nsegmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the\nAggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature\nrepresentation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability\nof the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a\npublic CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in\ncomparison with other competing methods.

2020-04-15	'Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and prediction of the human\n  interactome'	'  Structural elements of viral genomes regulate interactions in host cells.\nHere, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and\ncomputed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the 3 and 5 prime ends are\nhighly structured and the 5 prime end especially has strong propensity to\nassociate with proteins involved in replication and transcription. The domain\nencompassing nucleotides 23000-24000 is highly conserved at the sequence and\nstructural level, while the region upstream varies significantly. Both these\nsequences code for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with\nthe human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and could bind to\nsialic acids, as reported for the homologue from Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Our predictions indicate that the first 1000\nnucleotides in the 5 prime end interact with Double-stranded RNA-specific\nEditase 1 ADARB1, 2-5A-dependent Ribonuclease RNASEL, ATP-dependent RNA\nHelicase DDX1 and A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L, in addition to >20\nhigh-confidence candidate partners. These interactions, also implicated in HIV\nreplication, provide clues on host-virus interaction mechanisms.

Several artificial intelligence\nbased system are designed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest\nx-rays. In this article we will discuss the different approaches used for the\ndetection of COVID-19 and the challenges we are facing. It is mandatory to\ndevelop an automatic detection system to prevent the transfer of the virus\nthrough contact. Several deep learning architecture are deployed for the\ndetection of COVID-19 such as ResNet, Inception, Googlenet etc. All these\napproaches are detecting the subjects suffering with pneumonia while its hard\nto decide whether the pneumonia is caused by COVID-19 or due to any other\nbacterial or fungal attack.\n'	2020-04-11T16:15:53Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05436v1
2020-04-15	'A Time-dependent SIR model for COVID-19 with Undetectable Infected\n  Persons'	'  In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analyses to address the\nfollowing crucial questions for COVID-19: (Q1) Is it possible to contain\nCOVID-19? (Q2) If COVID-19 can be contained, when will be the peak and the end\nof the epidemic? (Q3) How do the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of\ndisease? (Q4) If COVID-19 cannot be contained, what is the ratio of the\npopulation that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity? (Q5) How\neffective are the social distancing approaches? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a\ntime-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time\nseries: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at\ntime t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models\nand more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by the\nChinese government, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers\nof confirmed cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is\nprecisely predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the\ntransmission rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted.\nAfter that day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3),\nwe extend our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable\nand undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model\nis characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely\nrelated to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at\nleast $1-1/R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5), we analyze\nthe independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration\nrandom graph. By relating the propagation probabilities in the IC model to the\ntransmission rates and recovering rates in the SIR model, we show 2 approaches\nof social distancing that can lead to a reduction of $R_0$.\n'	2020-04-11T14:35:37Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00122v5
2020-04-15	'One-shot screening of potential peptide ligands on HR1 domain in\n  COVID-19 glycosylated spike (S) protein with deep siamese network'	'  The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been declared to be a new international\nhealth emergence and no specific drug has been yet identified. Several methods\nare currently being evaluated such as protease and glycosylated spike (S)\nprotein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among coronavirus and\nhost cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the\nglycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the\nmost encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs.The novelty of the proposed\napproach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural\nnetwork toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has\nbeen trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two\ndifferent viruses family such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep\nlearning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019-nCoV\nprotein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on\npublic datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for\n2019-nCoV. Suddenly, the SNN shows a sensitivity of $83\\%$ of peptide affinity\nclassification, where $3027$ peptides on SATPdb bank have been tested towards\nthe specific region HR1 of 2019-nCoV exhibiting an affinity of $93\\%$ for the\npeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) peptide. This affinity between\nPPIase and HR1 can open new horizons of research since several scientific\npapers have already shown that CsA immunosuppression drug, a main inhibitor of\nPPIase, suppress the reproduction of different CoV virus included SARS-CoV and\nMERS-CoV. Finally, to ensure the scientific reproducibility, code and data have\nbeen made public at the following link: https://github.com/bionick87/2019-nCoV\n'	2020-04-11T09:23:54Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02136v3
2020-04-15	'Mathematical Modeling of Epidemic Diseases; A Case Study of the COVID-19\n  Coronavirus'	'  The outbreak of the Coronavirus COVID-19 has taken the lives of several\nthousands worldwide and locked-out many countries and regions, with yet\nunpredictable global consequences. In this research we study the epidemic\npatterns of this virus, from a mathematical modeling perspective. The study is\nbased on an extensions of the well-known susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)\nfamily of compartmental models. It is shown how social measures such as\ndistancing, regional lockdowns, quarantine and global public health vigilance,\ninfluence the model parameters, which can eventually change the mortality rates\nand active contaminated cases over time, in the real world. As with all\nmathematical models, the predictive ability of the model is limited by the\naccuracy of the available data and to the so-called level of abstraction used\nfor modeling the problem. In order to provide the broader audience of\nresearchers a better understanding of spreading patterns of epidemic diseases,\na short introduction on biological systems modeling is also presented and the\nMatlab source codes for the simulations are provided online.\n'	2020-04-10T23:42:26Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11371v2

The partially open state of S1 subunit in spike glycoprotein is\nconsidered vital for its infection with host cell and is represented as a key\ntarget for neutralizing antibodies. However, the mechanism elucidating the\ntransition from the closed state to the partially open state still remains\nunclear. Here, we applied a combination of Markov state model, transition path\ntheory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results explored a\npromising complete conformational movement of receptor-binding domain, from\nburied, partially open, to detached states. We also numerically confirmed the\ntransition probability between those states. Based on the asymmetry in both the\ndynamics behavior and backbone C$\\alpha$ importance, we further suggested a\nrelation between chains in the trimer spike protein, which may help in the\nvaccine design and antibody neutralization.\n'	2020-04-10T23:27:55Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05256v1

To gain adoption by\nthe health care community, we plan to validate our results in a clinical trial\nand three other venues in Mexico, Spain and the USA . However, if we had data\nfrom other on-going clinical trials and volunteers, we may do much more. For\nexample, for confirmed stay-at-home COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal audio\ntest could be developed to determine contact-with-hospital recommendations, and\nfor the most critical COVID-19 patients a success ratio forecast test,\nincluding patient clinical data, to prioritize ICU allocation. As a challenge\nto the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the\nauthors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and\ncrowdsourcing users will contribute more data. Previous approaches to complex\nAI tasks have either used a static dataset or were private efforts led by large\ncorporations. All existing COVID-19 trials published also follow this paradigm.\nInstead, we suggest a novel open collective approach to large-scale real-time\nhealth care AI.

Challenge hospitals are faced\nwith, in the fight against the virus, is the effective screening of incoming\npatients. One methodology is the assessment of chest radiography(CXR) images,\nwhich usually requires expert radiologists' knowledge. In this paper, we\npropose an explainable deep neural networks(DNN)-based method for automatic\ndetection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call\n'DeepCOVIDExplainer'. We used 16,995 CXR images across 13,808 patients,\ncovering normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. CXR images are first\ncomprehensively preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a\nneural ensemble method, followed by highlighting class-discriminating regions\nusing gradient-guided class activation maps(Grad-CAM++) and layer-wise\nrelevance propagation(LRP). Further, we provide human-interpretable\nexplanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show\nthat our approach can identify COVID-19 confidently with a positive predictive\nvalue(PPV) of 89.61% and recall of 83%, improving over recent comparable\napproaches. We hope that our findings will be a useful contribution to the\nfight against COVID-19 and, in more general, towards an increasing acceptance\nand adoption of AI-assisted applications in the clinical practice.\n"	2020-04-10T10:25:47Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04582v2
2020-04-15	'Impact of intervention on the spread of COVID-19 in India: A model based\n  study'	'  The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already\ncreated emergency situations in almost every country of the world. The disease\nspreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first\nidentification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks\nstarts on $2^{nd}$ March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing\nexponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific\nmedicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission\nmechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease\nproperly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease\ndynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in\nreducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to\ndescribe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We\nconsider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed\nmodel is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period\n$2^{nd}$ March, 2020 to $24^{th}$ March, 2020. We estimate the basic\nreproduction number $(R_0)$, effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic\ndoubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We\nfurther assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness,\nlock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two\nintervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the\nintervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggests\nthat higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak\nwithin a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nthe strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to\neradicate the disease effectively.\n'	2020-04-10T08:48:33Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04950v1
2020-04-15	'Expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the spike protein processing\n  enzymes in developing human embryos'	'  The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in thousands of critically\nill patients and poses a serious threat globally. To investigate if SARS-CoV-2\ncan affect early human embryos, we analysed scRNA-seq datasets of human embryos\nfor the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and BSG (CD147), the serine protease TMPRSS2\nfor viral spike protein priming, and the endosomal protease CTSL for spike\nprotein activation via the endosomal route. The results reveal that ACE2 and\nTMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast cells, and both BSG and\nCTSL are expressed in all the stages of embryonic development. The cells of the\nblastocysts express genes encoding for other coronavirus receptors such as DPP4\nand ANPEP as well. Interestingly, the cells of the epiblast also express genes\ninvolved in viral endocytosis and replication. We further identified 194 genes\nthat are differentially expressed in ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells as\ncompared to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the epiblast. Our results show\nthat developing human embryos express the receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and other\ncoronaviruses; embryos also harbour the necessary machinery for viral\ninternalization and replication. We suggest that couples be advised to avoid\nconceiving during the pandemic and that IVF procedures be kept to a minimum to\nprevent any possible hazard to the developing embryos.\n'	2020-04-10T08:02:33Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04935v1
2020-04-15	'Exploring the Effect of 2019-nCoV Containment Policies on Crime: The\n  Case of Los Angeles'	'  The global spread of 2019-nCoV, a new virus belonging to the coronavirus\nfamily, forced national and local governments to apply different sets of\nmeasures aimed at containing its outbreak. Los Angeles has been one of the\nfirst cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March\n4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving--among the\nothers--social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public\ngatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt\nand modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level\ninteractions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be\ninfluenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los\nAngeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this\nwork investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an\nimpact on crime trends in a metropolis using Bayesian structural time-series\n(BSTS) models. The article specifically focuses on nine urban crime categories,\ndaily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. The analyses have\nbeen updated bi-weekly (up to March 16\\ts{th} and up to March 28\\ts{th} 2020)\nto dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and hard interventions to\nshed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the\nenvironment. The results show that overall crime in Las Angeles is\nsignificantly decreasing, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft and battery.\nNo significant effect has been found for stolen vehicle, burglary, assault with\ndeadly weapon, intimate partner violence and homicide.

2020-04-15	'Dynamic Modeling COVID-19 for Comparing Containment Strategies in a\n  Pandemic Scenario'	'  The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States has\nforced federal and local governments to implement containment measures.\nMoreover, the severity of the situation has sparked engagement by both the\nresearch and clinical community with the goal of developing effective\ntreatments for the disease. This article proposes a time dynamic prediction\nmodel with competing risks for the infected individual and develops a simple\ntool for policy makers to compare different strategies in terms of when to\nimplement the strictest containment measures and how different treatments can\nincrease or suppress infected cases. Two types of containment strategies are\ncompared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of\ncitizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose\nstrict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the\ndisease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we\nconsider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases\nassuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is\navailable. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy,\nadaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum\ndaily number of cases. This, along with an effective treatment plan for the\ndisease can minimize death rate.\n'	2020-04-09T21:35:22Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13997v3

One of the\nquestions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the\nspread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR\nmodel previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also\ncaused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases\nin the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct\nfive different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out\nof control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000\npeople on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective\nand control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South\nKorean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario\n1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios\nwere devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\\%\neffectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the\ntransmission rate $\\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\\%, In this scenario\nactive cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission\nrate $\\beta$ was reduced to 70\\% of its initial value, in which the number of\ncases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\\beta$\nwas reduced to 80\\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about\n~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting\nmeasure to bring down the number of affected people by following the\nrecommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate\nmeasures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully\nthat will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.\n'	2020-04-09T19:56:41Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10047v2

This paper proposes a time-varying weighted\nPT encounter network to model the spreading of infectious diseases through the\nPT systems. Social activity contacts at both local and global levels are also\nconsidered. We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from\nSingapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and\nlightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and\nheterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the\nwhole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies\nfrom both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We\nfind that people\'s preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures\nto control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial\nclosure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading\nof epidemics. Identifying "influential passengers" using the smart card data\nand isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic\nspreading.\n'	2020-04-09T15:39:32Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04602v1

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and\nsmart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic sensing paradigm to\ncollect real-time observations from online users. In this vision paper we\npropose CovidSens, the concept of social-sensing-based risk alerting systems to\nnotify the general public about the COVID-19 spread. The CovidSens concept is\nmotivated by two recent observations: 1) people have been actively sharing\ntheir state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media,\nand 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than\npeople reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social\nmedia. We anticipate an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts\ngenerated by the social media users to build a real-time analytic system for\ngathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation.\nSpecifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions of: how\nto track the spread of the COVID-19? How to distill reliable information about\nthe disease with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the\nsocial media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the\nspread timely and effectively and alert them to remain prepared? In this vision\npaper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges\nin implementing reliable social-sensing-based risk alerting systems.

The CNN architecture that was used is called\nDenseNet121 and the optimization algorithm that was used is called the\ngravitational search algorithm (GSA). The GSA is adapted to determine the best\nvalues for the hyperparameters of the DenseNet121 architecture, and to achieve\na high level of accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 disease through chest x-ray\nimage analysis. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach was able\nto correctly classify 98% of the test set. To test the efficacy of the GSA in\nsetting the optimum values for the hyperparameters of DenseNet121, it was\ncompared to another optimization algorithm called social ski driver (SSD). The\ncomparison results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed\nGSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19 and its ability to better diagnose COVID-19 disease\nthan the SSD-DenseNet121 as the second was able to diagnose only 94% of the\ntest set.

2020-04-15	'Dynamic causal modelling of COVID-19'	'  This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of\ncoronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or\npopulation dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over\ntime. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends\npredictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional\ndependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social\ndistancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict\nwhat might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages\nstate-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison\nprocedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal\nensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological\npopulations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the\nmodel per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of\nthis paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some\ninteresting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear\neffects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.\n'	2020-04-09T10:13:44Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04463v1
2020-04-15	'Generic probabilistic modelling and non-homogeneity issues for the UK\n  epidemic of COVID-19'	'  Coronavirus COVID-19 spreads through the population mostly based on social\ncontact. To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with\nassociated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust\nmodelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible\nmodelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made.\nWe use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation\nin the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently\nprobabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational\nnature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and\nregions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as\nmedical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different\npossible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to\nsmall changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with\ndifferent scenarios.\n  This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an\nepidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR).\nIt is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model,\nare not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used\nwith extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent\nuncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw\ninsights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources,\nincluding agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based\nmodels.\n'	2020-04-09T09:39:16Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01991v2

2020-04-15	'Large Arabic Twitter Dataset on COVID-19'	'  The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged late December 2019 in China,\nis now rapidly spreading across the globe. At the time of writing this paper,\nthe number of global confirmed cases has passed one million and half with over\n75,000 fatalities. Many countries have enforced strict social distancing\npolicies to contain the spread of the virus. This has changed the daily life of\ntens of millions of people, and urged people to turn their discussions online,\ne.g., via online social media sites like Twitter. In this work, we describe the\nfirst Arabic tweets dataset on COVID-19 that we have been collecting since\nMarch 1st, 2020. The dataset would help researchers and policy makers in\nstudying different societal issues related to the pandemic. Many other tasks\nrelated to behavioral change, information sharing, misinformation and rumors\nspreading can also be analyzed.\n'	2020-04-09T01:07:12Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04315v1
2020-04-15	'COVID-19: A model for studying the evolution of contamination in Brazil'	'  In the present article we introduce an epidemiological model for the\ninvestigation of the spread of epidemics caused by viruses. The model is\napplied specifically to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus\n(aka "novel coronavirus"). The SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model\nis used as a basis for studying the evolution of the epidemic. Nevertheless, we\nhave modified some of the model hypotheses in order to obtain an estimate of\nthe contamination free of overestimated predictions. This extended model is\nthen applied to the case of the recent advance of the epidemic in Brazil. In\nthis regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of\ninfectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly,\nwe evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the\npopulation susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response\nto quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the\nfuture scenario of the epidemic depends significantly on the social behavior\nadopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures. The extent of\nsuch measures would be likely to cause thousands, millions or tens of millions\nof contaminations in the next few months.\n'	2020-04-08T23:07:57Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13932v4

As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos\nand posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter,\ndemonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus\nshowing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper\npresents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease\nposted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed.\nThe first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual\ntweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing\nthe patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect\non the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram,\nbigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The\nresults have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R2 and Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE). High values of R2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the\ngrounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been\nconducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this\ntime. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The\nresults showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only\nabout 15% were negative.\n'	2020-04-08T10:45:08Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03925v1

Extensive\nresearch is being conducted across the globe to identify therapeutic agents\nagainst the SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a powerful and efficient computational\nstrategy by combining machine learning (ML) based models and high-fidelity\nensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic\nmolecules (or ligands). Our screening is based on the binding affinity to\neither the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or to the\nSprotein-human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or\ndisrupting the host-virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy\nto two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands\nthat bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were\nthen validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were\nsubsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million\nentries) to provide a rank-ordered list of ~19,000 potentially useful compounds\nfor further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of\nsmall-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides an efficient\npathway to perform high-throughput computational drug screening by combining\nquick ML surrogate models with expensive high-fidelity simulations, for\naccelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.\n'	2020-04-08T01:33:53Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03766v1

It was\nstated by expert radiologists that COVID-19 displays different behaviours in CT\nimages. In this study, a novel method was proposed as fusing and ranking deep\nfeatures to detect COVID-19 in early phase. 16x16 (Subset-1) and 32x32\n(Subset-2) patches were obtained from 150 CT images to generate sub-datasets.\nWithin the scope of the proposed method, 3000 patch images have been labelled\nas CoVID-19 and No finding for using in training and testing phase.

Computational\nsimulations have played an important role to predict the development of the\ncurrent pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future\nprojections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control\naction in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a\nwell-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral\ndiseases. It has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, MERS\n(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and influenza. A general SEIR model\nrepresents an epidemic using four compartments in cascade; susceptible (S),\nexposed (E), infected (I), and recovery/removed (R), where the model assumes\nthat the epidemic exits with the infected population either recovered or\nremoved due to immunity to the virus. In this work, we present a modified SEIRS\nmodel with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and\nresusceptibiliy, where we tuned the exit conditions in the model to extend\npredictions on the projection of the current pandemic into three outcomes;\ndeath, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. Owing to\nhuge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model\naims to reflect better to the current scenario and case data reported. The\nmodel also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the\npopulation, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action\nmeasures, as well as resusceptiblity with temporary immune response.

Since\nthen, the disease has spread all over the world, with the United States\nbecoming the country with the highest number of cases. Governments around the\nworld have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures, including\nrecommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting\nsocial distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and\nstay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has\nvaried greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these\npublic safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain\nin effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be\ncontrolled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this\npaper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We\nfind that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according\nto this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the\ntotal number of deaths to ~72 thousand.

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and\ncomputed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against\nCOVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical\nspecialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical\nimaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image\nacquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also\nreshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best\nprotection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by\naccurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating\nsubsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help\nradiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking,\nand prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of\nmedical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image\nacquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on\nthe integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the\nfrontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging\nand radiology fighting against COVID-19.\n'	2020-04-07T08:18:43Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02731v2

It has been widely acknowledged that the most effective\npublic policy to mitigate the pandemic is \\emph{social and physical\ndistancing}: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home,\nclosing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal\nevidences suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease\nmitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social\ndistancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound\nmanner.\n  We propose to perform an optimal non-bipartite matching to pair counties with\nsimilar observed covariates but vastly different average social distancing\nscores during the first week (March 16th through Match 22nd) of President's\n\\emph{15 Days to Slow the Spread} campaign. We have produced a total of $302$\npairs of two U.S. counties with good covariate balance on a total of $16$\nimportant variables. Our primary outcome will be the average observed illness\ncollected by Kinsa Inc. two weeks after the intervention period. Although the\nobserved illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time\naspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded\nby counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three\nweeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome.

2020-04-15	'Information Seeking Responses to News of Local COVID-19 Cases: Evidence\n  from Internet Search Data'	'  The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a global pandemic with community\ncirculation in many countries, including the U.S. where every state is\nreporting confirmed cases. The course of this pandemic will be largely shaped\nby how governments enact timely policies, disseminate the information, and most\nimportantly, how the public reacts to them. Here, we examine informationseeking\nresponses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. By using\nan eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention\nto the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived,\neven though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong\nmeasures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their\nstate by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by\nsearches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other\nhand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g.,\nquarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g.,\nmasks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be\nimmediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our\nstudy period is relatively early in the epidemic and more elaborate policy\nresponses were not yet part of the public discourse.

This study analyses the most retweeted posts on Twitter during\n20 days in March to give insights into the issues that resonate with the\npublic, and the role Twitter may play in social distancing campaigns. It\nreports a thematic analysis of English-language tweets March 10-29, 2020,\nmentioning COVID-19 or coronavirus and with over 100,000 retweets.

The results\nsuggest that Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial\ntweets. For this, users shared social distancing information, helped build\nsupport for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed\nsupport for key workers, and helped each other to cope with social isolation.\nNevertheless, a few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that\ngovernment messages were not universally successful.

2020-04-15	'COVID-19: Analytics Of Contagion On Inhomogeneous Random Social Networks'	'  Motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the Covid-19\nepidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous\nrandom social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different\ntypes of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.\nAn epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on\nday $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals\' social\nbehaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability\ndistributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is\ngiven for the basic SI ("susceptible-infective") network contagion model, which\nfocusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main\nresult is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of\nthe system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves\nonly one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network\nmodels, including "removed" (R) and "exposed" (E) classes, are formulated.\nThese models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for\nthe SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of\ndifferent kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social\ndistancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an\nalgorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a\nnumber of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as\nthe framework\'s relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent\nbased contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic\nmodelling.\n'	2020-04-06T16:12:56Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02779v1
2020-04-15	'COVID-CAPS: A Capsule Network-based Framework for Identification of\n  COVID-19 cases from X-ray Images'	'  Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the\nworld as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19\nis extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early\ndiagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health\ncare professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition\nand flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test,\nhowever, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity and\nhigh false-negative rate. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on\nthe other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease.\nOverlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19\nchallenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to\ndevelop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive\nCOVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between\nimage instances and require large datasets. This paper presents an alternative\nmodeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS,\nbeing capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance\ndue to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our initial results based on a\ndataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous\nCNN-based models.

We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral\nstatus of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a\nlinear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as\ngenerated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm\nestimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our\napproach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than\nexisting noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to\nvarious applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.\nFinally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it\nis difficult to form such connections during a pandemic. We welcome new\ncollaborators to reach out and help improve this work!\n'	2020-04-06T14:12:20Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02689v1

Italy, that is widely considered one of the\nmain epicenters of the pandemic, has registered the highest COVID-2019 death\nrates and death toll in the world, to the present day. In this article I\nestimate an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast\nthe epidemic trend over the period after April 4, 2020, by using the Italian\nepidemiological data at national and regional level. The data refer to the\nnumber of daily confirmed cases officially registered by the Italian Ministry\nof Health (www.salute.gov.it) for the period February 20 to April 4, 2020.

2020-04-15	'COVID-19 forecasting based on an improved interior search algorithm and\n  multi-layer feed forward neural network'	'  COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within\nWuhan, China. As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all\nparts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS)\nbecomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model\nis presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days\nbased on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model,\nnamed ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based\non chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural\nnetwork (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the\nperformance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this\nmethodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its\nparameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding\nforecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data\nof the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the\nconfirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed\nforecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices\nincluding the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean\nabsolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization\nalgorithms are presented. The proposed model is investigated in the most\naffected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain). The experimental simulations\nillustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance rather\nthan the other algorithms while forecasting task for the candidate countries.\n'	2020-04-06T12:08:10Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05960v1

2020-04-15	'The Twitter Social Mobility Index: Measuring Social Distancing Practices\n  from Geolocated Tweets'	'  Social distancing is an important component of the response to the novel\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Minimizing social interactions and travel\nreduces the rate at which the infection spreads, and "flattens the curve" such\nthat the medical system can better treat infected individuals. However, it\nremains unclear how the public will respond to these policies. This paper\npresents the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and\ntravel derived from Twitter data. We use public geolocated Twitter data to\nmeasure how much a user travels in a given week. We find a large reduction in\ntravel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing\npolicies, with larger reductions in states that were early adopters and smaller\nchanges in states without policies. Our findings are presented on\nhttp://socialmobility.covid19dataresources.org and we will continue to update\nour analysis during the pandemic.\n'	2020-04-06T04:28:29Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02397v1
2020-04-15	'Deep Learning on Chest X-ray Images to Detect and Evaluate Pneumonia\n  Cases at the Era of COVID-19'	'  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first\nsymptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly\nspreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus\npandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary\ninfections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates\ndeep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with\nthe hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the\nCOVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets,\ndeep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from\npublicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are\nproposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is\nassumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context\nhave a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply\nhealth indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting\npatient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show\npossibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest\nX-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of\nCOVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models\nretained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators\nis highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections\nand health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.\n'	2020-04-05T21:30:54Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03399v1
2020-04-15	'Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics'	"  The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is rapidly spreading since December\n2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are\nlimited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal\npropagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global\nlocations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related\nto population migration from Hubei resembling a L\\'{e}vy flight which is\ncharacteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient\nquarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight\ncan be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that\nthe disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process.\nAt early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close\nto constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals\nbefore infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately\nexponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant\ndifferences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations.\nWhile most cities in China control the disease which resulted in the decaying\nstage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse\nprobably due to less social interactions control and overloaded health systems\nwhich reflects in the death and recovery rates.\n"	2020-04-05T17:19:15Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08382v2
2020-04-15	'COVID-19 Blockchain Framework: Innovative Approach'	'  The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of\nemerging SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of (COVID-19) coronavirus. The\ninfection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about\nthis epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the\neconomics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are\ncurrently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown\ninfected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to\nmitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for\nmitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion.\nThis study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the\npossibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage\nadvantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the\nunknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will\nenable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within\nconglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of\nP2P-Mobile Application.

In a desperate effort to\ndiscover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working\naround the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from\ncomputer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a\ntreasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based\nmodel using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on\nthree topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to\ncoronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more\ntopic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness\ncentrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to\ndrugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results\nreveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine,\nDexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral\npathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae\nvirus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide,\ninterferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus.

2020-04-15	'Detecting Suspected Epidemic Cases Using Trajectory Big Data'	'  Emerging infectious diseases are crucial threats to human health and global\nstability. The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly\nformed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge\neconomic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and\nisolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain\nthe outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we\nestablish an aggregated risk mean=field that contains information of all\nrisk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk\nmap. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency\nenabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk\nscoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop\nstatistical inference based method and machine learning based method for\ndetecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical\nexperiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of\nCOVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in\ncapturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be\napplied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community\nlevels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and\nstation. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk.\nThe detection rates as de ned by successful classification are above 90% as\nlong as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great\napplication potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.\n'	2020-04-05T02:17:19Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00908v2

Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of\nexact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and\ncombining this information with other personal information. This unprecedented\nencroachment on individual privacy at national scales has created an outcry and\nrisks rejection of these tools.\n  We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing\nfine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of\nan infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity\nof all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information\nor location history. Our approach is based on using short-range communication\nmechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It\ncan be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low\nfalse-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a\nnumber of extensions and tradeoffs.\n  We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage\nquick and broad voluntary adoption.

Thus, it is important to allocate a separate\nbudget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and\ndetecting new cases early on.\n  In this report, we consider the problem of allocating test-kits and discuss\nsome solution approaches.

Methods: A\nComputer-Aided Diagnostic model for the acceptable and non-invasive prediction\nof CAD using the State Space Advanced FCM (AFCM) approach is proposed. Also, a\nrule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the\nsystem and the interpretability of the decision mechanism.

We\nanalyze the rate $\\alpha$ in different countries, choosing as a starting point\nin each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12\ndays, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way.\nWe look for a link between the rate $\\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of\neach country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a {\\it base} set\nof 42 countries, which developed the epidemic earlier, and an {\\it extended}\nset of 88 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently.

2020-04-15	'Identifying highly influential travellers for spreading disease on a\n  public transport system'	'  The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines\nthe importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public\ntransport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for\ninfections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns\nand the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus\ncritical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For\ninstance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent\nin human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions\nsuch as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider\nmultiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for\nthe design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide\nsmart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus\npassengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the\ndistance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate\ndisease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We\ninvestigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while\nvarying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our\nresults show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions\nsimultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different\ngroups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single\ndimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given\nspecific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination\nefforts.\n'	2020-04-03T14:07:16Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01581v1

China, and subsequently, across the\nworld. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth\ntransmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected\ntransmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus\nand pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been\nasked by the public is "Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?". While\ndifferent regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases,\nthe screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and\nunderstanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The\nshortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our\nability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians\nare facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.\nOn one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the\nusage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the\npatients\' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being\ntested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under\ninvestigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical\nviewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and\ninaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general\npublic. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based\nreasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help\nthe general public understand and assess the situation rationally.

Our model contains only one fitting\nparameter, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health\norganisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that\nour model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data. It\npredicts that the disease will run its full course over six to seven months,\nstarting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the\nfirst 'Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1). The disease may be\nexpected to infect approximately 24% of the global population, i.e. about 1.83\nbillion people, taking approximately 86 million lives. Unless drastic new\ninterventions become possible, the global number of new cases is predicted to\npeak on day 129 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated 65 million\nnew cases per day. Since our simple model fits the available global data so\nwell, we suggest that the measures being taken so far to contain the pandemic\nmay be ineffective in curbing the global spread of the virus. As such, the\nefficacy of these measures should be more carefully weighed against their\nimpact on the world economy.\n"	2020-04-02T15:27:15Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10532v2

Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of\nthe pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and\ndeaths for countries worldwide and for US counties and provide prima facie\nevidence that it follows a power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able\nto explain the origin of this scaling behavior by the superposition of two\nconcurrent processes: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and\nthe small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming\nexponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is\ndetermined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm\nthis theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model,\ndescribing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our\ntheory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within\na few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the pandemic. By combining\nreal world data, modeling, and numerical simulations we make the case that that\nthe distribution of epidemic prevalence, and possibly that of spreading\nprocesses in general, might follow universal rules.\n'	2020-04-02T11:22:33Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00940v1

2020-04-15	'Detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Associated Pneumonia based on\n  Generative Adversarial Networks and a Fine-Tuned Deep Transfer Learning Model\n  using Chest X-ray Dataset'	"  The COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the devastating viruses according to the\nworld health organization. This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an\ninfection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to\ndetect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a\npneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN)\nwith a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be\npresented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and\nmade it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images\nfrom the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray\nimages with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10%\nof the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove\nthe efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\nSqueeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect\nthe pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small\nnumber of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the\ncomplexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination\nof GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing\naccuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most\nappropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and\nachieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and\nF1 score while using GAN as an image augmenter. Finally, a comparison result\nwas carried out at the end of the research with related work which used the\nsame dataset except that this research used only 10% of original dataset. The\npresented work achieved a superior result than the related work in terms of\ntesting accuracy.\n"	2020-04-02T08:14:37Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01184v1

Currently, the only management of\nthe disease depends on travel bans and social distancing. These strategies have\nresulted in large numbers of people in seclusion, with limited access to\naccurate information. To update the public, especially in South Africa,\nannouncements are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements\nnarrate the confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel\nhistory of people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the\nSouth African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily\ninfographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases,\nmortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of the patient and\nother nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily\nannouncements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this\ninformation, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the\nUniversity of Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying\npublicly available data in a way that is accessible and understandable using a\ndashboard. Through collaborative practices, a variety of challenges related to\npublicly available data in South Africa came to the fore. These include\nshortcomings in the accessibility, integrity, and data management practices\nbetween governmental departments and the South African public.

We\nalso propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits\nan evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data\nmust be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under\ncontrol. From our analysis it appears that the spreading reached saturation in\nChina, due to the strong containment policy of the national government. In\nSingapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new\nstrong spreading.

However, the main viral proteinase\n(Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design\nagainst SARS infection due to its vital role in polyproteins processing\nnecessary for coronavirus reproduction. The present in silico study was\ndesigned to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from\neucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular\ndocking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools.\nProtein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The\ncalculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity\nindicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site\nprediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand\nbinding.

Here, we estimate\nfrom European data that COVID-19 cases are expected to double initially every\nthree days, until social distancing interventions slow this growth, and that\nthe impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days - i.e. three\ndoubling times - after their implementation.

The COVID-19 has proved much more pervasive\ndemands for diagnosis that has driven researchers to develop more intelligent,\nhighly responsive and efficient detection methods. In this work, we focus on\nproposing AI tools that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals\nto diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of\na publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI\ntools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive\ndataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides\na simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and\ntransfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network\n(CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays\nand CT scan images dataset.

A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered\n(SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series\nof COVID-19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in\nvarious provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the\nspace dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal\nvariation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of\nscreening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city\nlockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict\nCOVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have\nresponded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although\nthese predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the\nmaximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the\ndifferent countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk\nparticle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction\nmodel, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate\nCOVID-19 spread.

Market\nexpectations have plummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis\nand mass unemployment. Governments provide huge financial aid programmes to\nmitigate the expected economic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with\ncyclical and fiscal policy measures, it is key to identify the industries that\nare most in need of support. In this study, we introduce a data-mining approach\nto measure the industry-specific risks related to COVID-19. We examine company\nrisk reports filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This\ndata set allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary\nfindings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business\nrisks is ahead of the overall stock market developments by weeks. The risk\nreports differ substantially between industries, both in magnitude and in\nnature. Based on natural language processing techniques, we can identify\ncorona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for different\nindustries. Our approach allows to distinguish the industries by their reported\nrisk awareness towards COVID-19. The preliminary findings are summarised an\nonline index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the industry-specific risk assessments\nrelated to the crisis, as it spreads through the economy. The tracking tool\ncould provide relevant empirical data to inform models on the immediate\neconomic effects of the crisis. Such complementary empirical information could\nhelp policy-makers to effectively target financial support and to mitigate the\neconomic shocks of the current crisis.\n"	2020-03-30T16:49:48Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12432v2

Methods: We performed a\nsystematic review to collate data from observational studies examining\nassociations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web\nof Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data\nwere extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary\ndata presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation\nsequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms\nunderlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion\ncriteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men\nwere at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with\nwomen. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group\ncompared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for\nmale. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of\nACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based\nimmunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is\npositively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly\nregulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an\nincreased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,\nwhich might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular\ncompositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell\nreceptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified\nas a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in\nmen.\n'	2020-03-30T15:15:01Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13547v1

2020-04-15	'COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size'	'  The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an\nunprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human\nsocieties. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the\noutbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely\ndisconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban\nareas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19\nin US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling\nrelationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading\nfaster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an\nuncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to\nbecome infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of\nthese observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need\nto implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also\npreserving socioeconomic activity.\n'	2020-03-29T16:45:15Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10376v2
2020-04-15	'Understanding the COVID19 Outbreak: A Comparative Data Analytics and\n  Study'	"  The Coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 virus, has emerged in Wuhan China\nsince late November 2019. Since that time, it has been spreading at large-scale\nuntil today all around the world. It is currently recognized as the world's\nmost viral and severe epidemic spread in the last twenty years, as compared to\nEbola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003. Despite being still in the middle of the\noutbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19. The\nobjective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in\nunprecedented fashion. This paper represents a first initiative to achieve this\ngoal, and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus.\nThe contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive\nmodels that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of\nextensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at\nanswering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world?\nWhat is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent,\nregion, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic\noutbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a\ncorrelation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a\ncomprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions mentioned above.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic analytical papers\nthat pave the way towards a better understanding of COVID-19. The analytical\ndashboards and collected data of this study are available online [1].\n"	2020-03-29T10:33:24Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14150v1
2020-04-15	'Convex Recovery of Marked Spatio-Temporal Point Processes'	'  We present a multi-dimensional Bernoulli process model for spatial-temporal\ndiscrete event data with categorical marks, where the probability of an event\nof a specific category in a location may be influenced by past events at this\nand other locations. The focus is to introduce general forms of influence\nfunction which can capture an arbitrary shape of influence from historical\nevents, between locations, and between different categories of events. The\ngeneral form of influence function differs from the commonly adapted\nexponential delaying function over time, and more importantly, in our model, we\ncan learn the delayed influence of prior events, which is an aspect seemingly\nlargely ignored in prior literature. Prior knowledge or assumptions on the\ninfluence function are incorporated into our framework by allowing general\nconvex constraints on the parameters specifying the influence function. We\ndevelop two approaches for recovering these parameters, using the constrained\nleast-square (LS) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our approach on synthetic examples and illustrate its promise\nusing real data (crime data and novel coronavirus data), in extracting\nknowledge about the general influences and making predictions.\n'	2020-03-29T03:23:30Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12935v1
2020-04-15	'Knowledge synthesis from 100 million biomedical documents augments the\n  deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors'	'  The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical\nknowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite\nthe recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding\nunstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the\nexponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation\nwith deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform\nfor dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations\nextracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with\nSingle Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this\nplatform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of\nCOVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor\nACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes and olfactory epithelial cells are\nlikely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, correlating with\nreported loss of sense of taste and smell as early indicators of COVID-19\ninfection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Airway club cells,\nciliated cells and type II pneumocytes in the lung, and enterocytes of the gut\nalso express ACE2. This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform\ncan leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly\navailable data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights\nand hypotheses.\n'	2020-03-28T11:48:32Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12773v1

In all\nefforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a\nvaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for\nboth the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through\nserological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic\nindices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related\nto how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and\nstories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 1000\nday-scale time series of 1-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most\n`important' for March 2020 with respect to March 2019. We determine importance\nthrough our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make\nsome basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison\nto numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe\nacross all languages a peak for the language-specific word for `virus' in\nJanuary followed by a decline through February and a recent surge through\nMarch. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out\nfrom China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis\nwhile relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time\nseries to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as\nwell as for retrospective investigations.\n"	2020-03-27T19:47:31Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12614v1
2020-04-15	'Estimating Uncertainty and Interpretability in Deep Learning for\n  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Detection'	'  Deep Learning has achieved state of the art performance in medical imaging.\nHowever, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the\naccuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a\ndecision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical\ndiagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and\ntherefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)\ninfections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting\nCOVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment.\nHowever, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet\ninevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights\nbased Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in\nDeep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the\nhuman-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and\nshow that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of\nprediction.

Thus, our developed\nelectrical Gr-FET immunosensors provide an appealing alternative to address the\nearly screening/diagnosis as well as the analysis and rational design of\nneutralizing-antibody locking methods of this ongoing public health crisis.\n'	2020-03-27T16:46:01Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12529v1
2020-04-15	'Splitting one ventilator for multiple patients -- a technical assessment'	'  Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, many efforts and innovative solutions\nhave surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon\ncatastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator\nto treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are\nobvious risks and little is known on how the technique would work on patients\nwith ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs\nof equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but\nthat large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different\ncompliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility\nof the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments\nexpanding on the previous studies with different ventilator setting and lung\ncharacteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal\nvolumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations\nof lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and\nend-expiratory pressure levels. We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal\nvolumes for paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence\nfrom differences in airway resistances, and that higher PEEP settings could\nstrongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. The most\nbalanced, although far from ideal, delivery of tidal volumes for the test lungs\nwith different compliance was measured using pressure-controlled ventilation\nwith a maximum inspiratory pressure of 30 mbar and a PEEP at 6 or 10 mbar. From\nthis study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify\nreliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards\nof the technique.\n'	2020-03-27T12:04:15Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12349v1

2020-04-15	'COVID-19 Screening on Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Learning based\n  Anomaly Detection'	'  Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. To date the novel\nCOVID-19 coronavirus is rapidly spreading worldwide and subsequently\nthreatening health of billions of humans. Clinical studies have shown that most\nCOVID-19 patients suffer from the lung infection. Although chest CT has been\nshown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis,\nchest Xray is more widely available due to its faster imaging time and\nconsiderably lower cost than CT. Deep learning, one of the most successful AI\ntechniques, is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast\namount of chest X-ray images, which can be critical for efficient and reliable\nCOVID-19 screening. In this work, we aim to develop a new deep anomaly\ndetection model for fast, reliable screening. To evaluate the model\nperformance, we have collected 100 chest X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed\nwith COVID-19 from the Github repository. To facilitate deep learning, more\ndata are needed. Thus, we have also collected 1431 additional chest X-ray\nimages confirmed as other pneumonia of 1008 patients from the public\nChestX-ray14 dataset. Our initial experimental results show that the model\ndeveloped here can reliably detect 96.00% COVID-19 cases (sensitivity being\n96.00%) and 70.65% non-COVID-19 cases (specificity being 70.65%) when evaluated\non 1531 Xray images with two splits of the dataset.\n'	2020-03-27T11:32:18Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12338v1
2020-04-15	'$α$-Satellite: An AI-driven System and Benchmark Datasets for\n  Hierarchical Community-level Risk Assessment to Help Combat COVID-19'	'  The novel coronavirus and its deadly outbreak have posed grand challenges to\nhuman society: as of March 26, 2020, there have been 85,377 confirmed cases and\n1,293 reported deaths in the United States; and the World Health Organization\n(WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - which has infected more\nthan 531,000 people with more than 24,000 deaths in at least 171 countries - a\nglobal pandemic. A growing number of areas reporting local sub-national\ncommunity transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the\nbattle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for\nexpanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID-19 and\nthus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. By\nadvancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the\nlarge-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g.,\ndisease related data from official public health organizations, demographic\ndata, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work,\nwe propose and develop an AI-driven system (named $\\alpha$-Satellite}, as an\ninitial offering, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment to\nassist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving\nCOVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user\ninput or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically\nprovide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state,\ncounty, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate\nactions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent\npossible.

Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain\nof the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region,\nfollowed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity\nbetween the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and\nthe hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is\nthought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of\nthis preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation\nin the COVID-19 research field making use of an already-established literature\non the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, respiratory infections\nand the hepcidin protein.

The structures of social contact critically determine the spread of\nthe infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structures\nthrough large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective\nmeans of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with social\ncontact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study the\nprogress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 and\nits time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, age\ndistribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancing\nmeasures - workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown - and their\nefficacy with durations are then investigated. A three-week lockdown is found\ninsufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustained\nlockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for the\nreduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these\nmeasures. Our study underlines the importance of age and social contact\nstructures in assessing the country-specific impact of mitigatory social\ndistancing.\n'	2020-03-26T17:54:23Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12055v1
2020-04-15	'Quantitative assessment of the role of undocumented infection in the\n  2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic'	'  An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role\nof undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking\ninto account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters\ndetermined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using\ndata from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is\ncapable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of\nconfirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The\ndrastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different\ncountries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as\nthe duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the\noccurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating\nits reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that\ninsufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented\ninfection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that\ncountry. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model\npredicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did\nnot impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is\nthat, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a\nnon-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been\ndeemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently\nimposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving\ninto a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting\nthe necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the\nhidden individuals.\n'	2020-03-26T16:50:16Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12028v1

As the number of affected patients increase\nrapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may\nlead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize\nautomatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest\nCT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting\nassessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age\n45.3$\\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,\nfrom which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the\nwhole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are\ncalculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity\n(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each\nquantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of\nCOVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross\nvalidation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive\nrate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of\nquantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the\nwhole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to\nthe severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the\nright lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left\nlung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment\n(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.\nSeveral quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity\nof COVID-19, were revealed.\n'	2020-03-26T15:49:32Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11988v1

2020-04-15	'Diffusion as a First Model of Spread of Viral Infection'	'  The appearance of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in late 2019 has dominated the\nnews in the last few months as it developed into a pandemic. In every\nmathematics and physics classroom, instructors are using the time series of the\nnumber of cases to show exponential growth of the infection. In this manuscript\nwe propose a simple diffusion process as the mode of spreading infections. This\nmodel is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, but it can\ncapture the exponential growth and it can explain it in terms of mobility\n(diffusion constant), population density, and probability of transmission.\nStudents can change the parameters and determine the growth rate and predict\nthe total number of cases as a function of time. Students are also given the\nopportunity to add other factors that are not considered in the simple\ndiffusion model.\n'	2020-03-25T15:39:05Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11449v1

2020-04-15	'Statistical investigation of relationship between spread of coronavirus\n  disease (COVID-19) and environmental factors based on study of four mostly\n  affected places of China and five mostly affected places of Italy'	'  COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated in China in the\nmonth of December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On\n31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health\nOrganization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries\naround the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing\nthat it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly\ninvestigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity\n(RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max),\nconsidering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for\nfour of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai,\nWuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona,\nLodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative\nhumidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with\nmaximum temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate.\n'	2020-03-25T08:49:33Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11277v1

The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was\ndiscovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end\nof 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of\ninfected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the\nupdated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of\nthis article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net\nto assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.\nMaterials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study\nis validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19\ncases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep\nconvolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group\nNetwork (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural\nnetwork model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image\nto classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.\nResults: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully\ndone based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,\nrespectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models\nshowed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with\nf1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:\nThis study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to\nclassify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework.\nClinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.\n'	2020-03-24T18:21:10Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11055v1

This study explores\nthe potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this\nCOVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given\nthe interest in the topic. Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT)\nusing one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are\nworldwide, China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The reported period is 15\nJanuary 2020 to 24 March 2020. The results show that the highest worldwide peak\nin the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the\nfirst peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second\nwave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy,\nwith the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as\nthe first wave.

The virus has gone through various pathways of\nevolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,\ngenotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate\nmethod for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes.\nThe method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with\nthe SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard\ndistances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis\nof SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations\nare the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method\nserves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic\nviruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis\nshows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase,\nand nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations.

2020-04-15	'Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case\n  of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak'	'  Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many\nlives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime\nso to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing\nborders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such\ncurfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being\nable to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important\nbut difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high\nuncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence\nthe widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another\nfactor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often\nscarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand,\nfinding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big\nchallenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been\nproposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel\nselection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3)\nfine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest\npossible accuracy.

Materials and Methods: Multiple\ninternational datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were\nincluded. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning\nmodels, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with\nclinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to\nanalyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19\nthoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient\nover time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study\nincludes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results:\nClassification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT\nstudies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and\ninfected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2%\nspecificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output\nenables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and\nvisualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume\ndisplay.

2020-04-15	'Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application'	"  In order to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, almost everyone\nwears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial\nrecognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access\ncontrol, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at\ntrain stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition\nperformance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces.\nMost current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep\nlearning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present,\nthere are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end,\nthis work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face\nDetection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD)\nand Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best\nof our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face\ndataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on\nwhich various applications on masked faces can be developed. The\nmulti-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95%\naccuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry.

2020-04-15	'Eliminating COVID-19: A Community-based Analysis'	'  We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the\ndisease among individuals both within and between communities. A set of\ncommunities can be defined as any partition of a population such that\ntravel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g.\nthe U.S. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). COVID-19\ncan be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the\nexpected/average number of other communities to which a single infected\ncommunity will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that\nthis community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel\nrate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before\ncommunity-level action is taken. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed at\nwhich communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak.\nThe analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not\nnecessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at\nonce, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. The\nsooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in\nplace. If infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the\nfuture) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities\n(and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will\nexponentially decrease over time.\n'	2020-03-23T05:17:27Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10086v1
2020-04-15	'Composite Monte Carlo Decision Making under High Uncertainty of Novel\n  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction'	'  In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,\ngovernments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions\nunder high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)\nsimulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are\nbroken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many\npossible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability\ndistributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested\ncases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities\naround the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the\npopulation density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds\nand the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is\nreliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of\na CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and\nthe correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case\nstudy of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule\ninduction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development\nis experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a\nMC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction\nof fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited\nfrom a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell\nabout the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.\n'	2020-03-22T11:58:43Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09868v1
2020-04-15	'A SIDARTHE Model of COVID-19 Epidemic in Italy'	'  In late December 2019, a novel strand of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a\nsevere, potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) was identified in\nWuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing outbreaks in multiple world\ncountries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit country\noutside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a\ntotal of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for\nSARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of\nparamount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an\neffective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a\nnew epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on\nwhether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The\ndistinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because\nnon-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than\ndiagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain\nmisperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic\nphenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop\nlife-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires\nhospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the\nhealthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be\nredefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic\ncontainment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19\nepidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different\npossible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.\n'	2020-03-22T11:17:18Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09861v1

It is of great importance to rapidly\nand accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia\n(CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients\nof CAP underwent thin-section CT.

An infection Size Aware Random Forest method\n(iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups\nwith different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in\neach group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of\n0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against\ncomparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size\nin the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics\nfeatures show slightly improvement.

2020-04-15	'On a quarantine model of coronavirus infection and data analysis'	'  Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine\nmeasures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the\nnumber of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still\nexhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this\nbrief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by\nmeans of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we\nintroduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all\ninfected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that\nthey cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is\ndetermined by the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of\nnewly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different\ncompared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\\mathcal{R}_0 >1$, then the\nnumber of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if\n$\\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions\nimposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays\nexponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development\nin different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth\ndynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth).\nAnalysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection\n(maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting\nmeasures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the\ntotal number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate\nremains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced\nquarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.\n'	2020-03-20T18:22:59Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09444v1
2020-04-15	'The early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy'	'  In the night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus\ndisease (COVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week\nthat followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of\ncases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the\nfirst epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western\nCountry. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of\nconfirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds,\ndates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results,\nhospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction\nnumber and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than\nFebruary 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the\nepidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The\nmedian age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of\npositive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.\nThe mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We\nestimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We\nestimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around\nFebruary 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in\nnasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of\nCOVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely\nunsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon.

2020-04-15	'Modelling and predicting the spatio-temporal spread of Coronavirus\n  disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy'	'  Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest\npossible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to\nmodel the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level.\nData time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the\nfirst case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern\nItaly, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series\nmixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been\nimplemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the\nphenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide\nreliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three\nsubcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the\nevolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission\nof the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the\neffects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of\nnearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in\nItaly, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on\nthe others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an\nerror of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level,\ninstead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces\nfirst concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the\neffects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are\ncurrently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the\nspatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed\nmodel provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while\ncontrolling for delayed reporting.\n'	2020-03-20T14:07:09Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06664v2

The\ndetection process was implemented on abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) images.\nThe expert radiologists detected from CT images that COVID-19 shows different\nbehaviours from other viral pneumonia. Therefore, the clinical experts specify\nthat COV\\.ID-19 virus needs to be diagnosed in early phase. For detection of\nthe COVID-19, four different datasets were formed by taking patches sized as\n16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 from 150 CT images. The feature extraction process\nwas applied to patches to increase the classification performance. Grey Level\nCo-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Directional Pattern (LDP), Grey Level Run\nLength Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Discrete\nWavelet Transform (DWT) algorithms were used as feature extraction methods.\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) classified the extracted features. 2-fold, 5-fold\nand 10-fold cross-validations were implemented during the classification\nprocess. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score metrics\nwere used to evaluate the classification performance. The best classification\naccuracy was obtained as 99.68% with 10-fold cross-validation and GLSZM feature\nextraction method.\n'	2020-03-20T12:48:39Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09424v1
2020-04-15	'Coronavirus and oil price crash'	'  Coronavirus (COVID-19) creates fear and uncertainty, hitting the global\neconomy and amplifying the financial markets volatility. The oil price reaction\nto COVID-19 was gradually accommodated until March 09, 2020, when, 49 days\nafter the release of the first coronavirus monitoring report by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia floods the market with oil. As a\nresult, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against\nthis background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of\nCOVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of\nfinancial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty.\nOur ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new\ninfections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long\nrun. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19\nalso has an indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices.\n'	2020-03-20T10:56:20Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06184v2
2020-04-15	'Trend analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and the rest of the\n  world'	'  The recent epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) that started in China has\nalready been "exported" to more than 140 countries in all the continents,\nevolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze\nthe trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in\nsome countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported.\nNotably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an\nexponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem\nto fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out\nrecently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down\nwith growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic\nwas contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries\nlike, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other\nEuropean countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first\ncountries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems\nto follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most\naffected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local\ncase. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give\ninterpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and\nconclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases,\nare not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.\n'	2020-03-19T22:22:07Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09032v1
2020-04-15	'Coronavirus Perceptions And Economic Anxiety'	"  We provide the first analysis of how the global spread of the novel\ncoronavirus affects contemporaneous economic sentiment. First, we collect a\nglobal dataset on internet searches indicative of economic anxieties. We find\nthat the arrival of coronavirus in a country led to a substantial increase in\nsuch internet searches of up to 58 percent. Second, leveraging two US\nrepresentative survey experiments conducted in early and mid-March 2020, we\ndocument a rapid surge in economic anxieties after the arrival of the\ncoronavirus in the US. Third, to understand how information about the\ncoronavirus affects these anxieties, we measure perceptions about the\ncoronavirus. We find substantial heterogeneity in participants' beliefs about\nthe mortality from and contagiousness of the virus. Fourth, experimentally\nproviding participants with information about mortality and contagiousness\ncausally affects participants' worries regarding the aggregate economy and\ntheir personal economic situation. Finally, we document that participants'\nsubjective mental models understate the non-linear nature of disease spread,\nand that these mental models shape the extent of economic worries. These\nresults underscore the importance of public education about the virus for\nsuccessful containment as well as the need for timely measures that decrease\neconomic hardship and anxiety during a major global pandemic.\n"	2020-03-19T17:16:47Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03848v2

Achieving\ncontainment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual's\nlocation and contact history. Traditionally, this process is labor intensive,\nsusceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the\nrecent almost ubiquitous availability of smart phones, many people carry a tool\nwhich can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual's contacts\nduring an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus crisis.\nUnfortunately, the very same first-generation contact tracing tools have been\nused to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most\nprivate details about individuals. We seek to outline the different\ntechnological approaches to mobile-phone based contact-tracing to date and\nelaborate on the opportunities and the risks that these technologies pose to\nindividuals and societies. We describe advanced security enhancing approaches\nthat can mitigate these risks and describe trade-offs one must make when\ndeveloping and deploying any mass contact-tracing technology. With this paper,\nour aim is to continue to grow the conversation regarding contact-tracing for\nepidemic and pandemic containment and discuss opportunities to advance this\nspace.

2020-04-15	'Short-term predictions and prevention strategies for COVID-2019: A model\n  based study'	'  An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing\ntill December 2019. As of March 16 2020, It has caused an epidemic outbreak\nwith more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths\nworldwide. During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is\nestablished and reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID) are rising\nworldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and\ncontrol the virus with limited resource. In this study, we propose and analyze\na compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak.\nThe basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated\nanalytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to\nobserve the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit\ndaily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan,\nZhejiang and Hunan. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining\nhuman-to-human spread ($R_0>1$, $R_c>1$) is already present in all the five\nprovinces. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID\ncases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. However, long\nterm predictions for Hubei reveals that the symptomatic COVID cases will show\noscillatory behaviour. Further, we found that effective management of\nquarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated\nindividuals to reduce the disease burden. Numerical results show that the\nmodification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and\ntransmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei.\nThus, COVID is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and\nincreasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. Health care officials\nshould supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in\nthe affected areas.\n'	2020-03-18T10:59:32Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08150v1

2020-04-15	'Prediction and analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019'	"  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was found in a seafood wholesale market\nin Wuhan, China. WHO officially named this coronavirus as COVID-19. Since the\nfirst patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total\nof 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020.\nWuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of\nthe whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic\nprevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have\nreported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19\nepidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic\ndevelopment. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e.,\nLogistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of\nSARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the\nexisting mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the\nsituation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical\nmodels are different for different parameters and in different regions. In\ngeneral, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three\nmodels studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be\nbetter than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the\nthree models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447\nin Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas and 80261-85140 in China respectively.\nThe total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in Non-Hubei areas and\n3150-6286 in China respetively.

The new type of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered\nin Wuhan-China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of\nthe world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the\nworld countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There\nare many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including\nclinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed\nCOVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly,\nseveral techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such\nas medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it\ntakes time to install them and use.

2020-04-15	'The effect of interurban movements on the spatial distribution of\n  population in China'	'  Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of\nthe population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental\ningredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all\ntransportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results\nfor 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating\nthe spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel\nflows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial\nfluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they\nappear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,\ncreating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These\nmovements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population\nconcentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the\nreturn to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us\nto show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New\nYear due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread\nof the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of\nkeeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring\nintra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These\nresults shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national\ndistribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective\ncontrol strategies at a national level.\n'	2020-03-16T15:14:28Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07276v1

2020-04-15	'Possibility of Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Human\n  Respiratory Tract by Controlled Ethanol Vapor Inhalation'	'  Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza are lipophilic, enveloped viruses,\nand are relatively easy to inactivate by exposure to alcohols. The envelope\nmainly consists of the lipid bilayer, taken from the host cells at\nassembly/budding stage of the viral life cycle. Therefore the constitution of\nthe lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses,\neven after mutations, and thus these closely-related viruses will be\ndisinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same concentration. Existing\nexperimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v% is\nsufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author\nsuggests that it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v%\nconcentration for this disinfection process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water\ndilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available and safe\n(non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\\circ$C (122~140$^\\circ$F)\nthrough the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside\nthe respiratory tract; mainly in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration\nwill be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which is enough to disinfect\nthe corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more\nmoisture into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal\ncavity by stimulating blowing of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator\nwork actively so that the self-clearing mechanism in the trachea will remove\nviruses faster. An alternative prompt method is also discussed. We use 40 v/v%\nwhisky or similar alcohol, dripping on a gauze, inhale the vapor slowly at room\ntemperature. This method works well for the front part of the nasal cavity.\nThis is suitable for clinical workers, because they may need to use prompt\npreventative measures at any time.\n'	2020-03-15T00:51:22Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12444v1

To better understand viral tropism, we\nassessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the\nviral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in\nsingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals\ngenerated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as\nthe protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut\nepithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree\nreveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and\nciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells\nanalyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins\ntowards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity.\nFinally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway\nepithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly\nenriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways\nmight have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral\npathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral\ninfection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the\nHuman Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the\ncompendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and\nciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2\ninfection.

We selected nine drugs from HIV-1\nprotease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based\non their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active\nsite-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of\ninteractions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory\npotency of candidates are as follows\nTipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1\nprotease inhibitors and Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin for\nanti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and\nthe hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their\nmetabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for\ntheir overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey\nby clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus\ninfections.\n'	2020-03-10T03:49:45Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04524v1

2020-04-15	'Spatiotemporal fluctuation scaling law and metapopulation modeling of\n  the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks'	'  We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological\ncharacteristics. Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to\ncharacterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001)\nunified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al.\n(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)]\nto approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL\nanalysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific\nheterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for\ncumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections,\nsuggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter\n(M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds\n(COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health\ninterventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the\ninfection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and\nbelow which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0\ncoincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19\noutbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection\nthreshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality\nrates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity\nUNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of\ncoronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\\theta} and M, borrowed\nfrom neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of\ninfection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of\nwhich may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health\ninterventions.\n'	2020-03-08T04:17:46Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03714v1

To avoid a\nlarger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of\nstrong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine\nis the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to\nestimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into\nseven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and\nofficially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model\nis given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the\ntransmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend\nof the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role\nin controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The\ncontrol reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and\ndiscussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is\nin decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human\ntransmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may\nbecome a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease\nis still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the\nvirus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index\nis introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high\nand low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail\nvaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the\neffectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the\nnumerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.\n'	2020-03-06T01:06:54Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02985v1

However,\nthe development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few\nmonths. Thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that\ncan be used immediately.

An outbreak of this disease has been\nreported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter.\nThe disease has also been exported to other countries, including the\nPhilippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February\n2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary\nmathematical models are formulated by various international study groups.

Proposed model-based\nstrategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such\nas during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the\nexposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic\nreproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected\nperson staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people.\nAssuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of\nthe social gathering should have a protection with more than 70 percent\neffectiveness.\n'	2020-02-28T15:55:24Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05296v3
2020-04-15	'Dynamic Graph Correlation Learning for Disease Diagnosis with Incomplete\n  Labels'	'  Disease diagnosis on chest X-ray images is a challenging multi-label\nclassification task. Previous works generally classify the diseases\nindependently on the input image without considering any correlation among\ndiseases. However, such correlation actually exists, for example, Pleural\nEffusion is more likely to appear when Pneumothorax is present. In this work,\nwe propose a Disease Diagnosis Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN) that\npresents a novel view of investigating the inter-dependency among different\ndiseases by using a dynamic learnable adjacency matrix in graph structure to\nimprove the diagnosis accuracy. To learn more natural and reliable correlation\nrelationship, we feed each node with the image-level individual feature map\ncorresponding to each type of disease. To our knowledge, our method is the\nfirst to build a graph over the feature maps with a dynamic adjacency matrix\nfor correlation learning. To further deal with a practical issue of incomplete\nlabels, DD-GCN also utilizes an adaptive loss and a curriculum learning\nstrategy to train the model on incomplete labels. Experimental results on two\npopular chest X-ray (CXR) datasets show that our prediction accuracy\noutperforms state-of-the-arts, and the learned graph adjacency matrix\nestablishes the correlation representations of different diseases, which is\nconsistent with expert experience. In addition, we apply an ablation study to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of each component in DD-GCN.\n'	2020-02-28T09:07:04Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11629v2

2020-04-15	'Simulating the Spread of Epidemics in China on the Multi-layer\n  Transportation Network: Beyond the Coronavirus in Wuhan'	'  Based on the SEIR model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a\ngeneral-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is\nbuilt. The Chinese public transportation system between over 340\nprefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with\nlayers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail\nroutes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities,\nperipheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local\nspread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the\noverlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different\ntransmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the\ntransit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation\nvehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the\ninfected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the\nrecovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be\nused to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other\ncountries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction\nnumber, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from\nany Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective\ngovernment interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to\ntrigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from\nempirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The\nmodel is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that\nthe framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public\ncity-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.\n'	2020-02-27T17:44:33Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12280v1

2020-04-15	'Abnormal respiratory patterns classifier may contribute to large-scale\n  screening of people infected with COVID-19 in an accurate and unobtrusive\n  manner'	'  Research significance: During the epidemic prevention and control period, our\nstudy can be helpful in prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients\ninfected with COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) based on breathing\ncharacteristics. According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory\npattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the\ncommon cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea.\nPeople infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be\nutilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be\npreliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in\nsituations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research\ndetails: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of\npeople in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work,\nwe innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this\ngoal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is\nnot enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of\ndifferent types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation\nis small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory\nsignals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first\nproposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce\nreal-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with\nbidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically\nsignificant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots,\nCheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling\nideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such\nas public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.\n'	2020-02-12T09:42:57Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05534v1

2020-04-15	'The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More\n  Infectious Than Initially Estimated'	'  The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that\nhas spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number,\nR0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this\nquantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key\nepidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these\nestimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with\nmathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals\nduring early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be\nbetween 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of\nsymptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control\nmeasures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.\n'	2020-02-09T02:42:18Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03268v1
2020-04-15	'Protein structure and sequence re-analysis of 2019-nCoV genome does not\n  indicate snakes as its intermediate host or the unique similarity between its\n  spike protein insertions and HIV-1'	'  As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global\npneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular\nmechanisms is sorely needed. In this report, we re-analyzed the computational\napproaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al.\n(https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al.\n(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871), which concluded that snakes are\nthe intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein\ninsertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1. Results from our\nre-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using\nstate-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, do not support the\nconclusions proposed by these manuscripts. Based on our analyses and existing\ndata of coronaviruses, we concluded that the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV\nare more likely to be mammals and birds than snakes, and that the "novel\ninsertions" observed in the spike protein are naturally evolved from bat\ncoronaviruses.\n'	2020-02-08T14:24:59Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03173v1
2020-04-15	'A Robust Stochastic Method of Estimating the Transmission Potential of\n  2019-nCoV'	'  The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has quickly evolved\ninto a global health crisis. The transmission potential of 2019-nCoV has been\nmodelled and studied in several recent research works. The key factors such as\nthe basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by\nfitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data\ninclude the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities\nover the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV\nfrom the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light\nof varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak.\nSample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when\noutliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters\nof transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with\n$R_0:8\\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large\ninitial infected group.\n'	2020-02-07T16:01:28Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03828v1
2020-04-15	'A Time Delay Dynamic System with External Source for the Local Outbreak\n  of 2019-nCoV'	'  How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the\nmost urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. In this paper, we\npropose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the\ntrend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in\nthe newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected\npeople travel to different areas. The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic\nsystem with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and\nthe rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of\ncumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation\nresults with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have\nsome more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the\nlocal cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control.\n'	2020-02-07T02:28:26Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02590v1
2020-04-15	'A Simple Prediction Model for the Development Trend of 2019-nCov\n  Epidemics Based on Medical Observations'	"  In order to predict the development trend of the 2019 coronavirus\n(2019-nCov), we established an prediction model to predict the number of\ndiagnoses case in China except Hubei Province. From January 25 to January 29,\n2020, we optimized 6 prediction models, 5 of them based on the number of\nmedical observations to predicts the peak time of confirmed diagnosis will\nappear on the period of morning of January 29 from 24:00 to February 2 before 5\no'clock 24:00. Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24\no'clock on January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the\n3rd has a small deviation from the actual value, and the actual value has\nalways remained within the range predicted by the comprehensive prediction\nmodel 6. Therefore we discloses this finding and will continue to track whether\nthis pattern can be maintained for longer. We believe that the changes medical\nobservation case number may help to judge the trend of the epidemic situation\nin advance.\n"	2020-02-02T16:20:11Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00426v1
2020-04-15	'Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan\n  novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV'	"  Objectives.--To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel\ncoronavirus (2019-nCoV). Methods.--Based on the\nsusceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the\nassumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before January 25,\n2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the\nbasic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed\ncases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of\ninfected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological\ndeterminants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results The\nbasic reproduction number falls between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time\nreports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China,\nand falls between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected\ncases from colleagues. Conclusions.--The early transmission ability of\n2019-nCoV is closed to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable\ndisease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control\nmeasures are needed to suppress the further transmissions. Notes Added.--Using\na newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the\nestimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0].\n"	2020-01-31T14:53:50Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10530v2

2020-04-15	'Estimation of temporal covariances in pathogen dynamics using Bayesian\n  multivariate autoregressive models'	'  It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological\ncommunities of interacting organisms within their hosts. Although community\necology approaches have been applied to determine pathogen interactions at the\nwithin-host scale, methodologies enabling robust inference of the\nepidemiological impact of pathogen interactions are lacking. Here we developed\na novel statistical framework to identify statistical covariances from the\ninfection time-series of multiple pathogens simultaneously. Our framework\nextends Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models to analyse multivariate\ntime series data by accounting for within- and between-year dependencies in\ninfection risk and incorporating a between-pathogen covariance matrix which we\nestimate. Importantly, our approach accounts for possible confounding drivers\nof temporal patterns in pathogen infection frequencies, enabling robust\ninference of pathogen-pathogen interactions. We illustrate the validity of our\nstatistical framework using simulated data and applied it to diagnostic data\navailable for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban\npopulation between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human\nmetapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found\npositive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions\namong specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community\necology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with\nimportant utility for public health planning and preparedness.\n'	2019-04-13T22:02:39Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09063v4
2020-04-15	'Feline coronaviruses associated with feline infectious peritonitis have\n  modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions'	"  Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the\nfeline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical\nfeline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis\nvirus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive\ninfection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell\ntropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP\nprogression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have\nshown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation\nsite located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike\n(S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and\nto obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our\nlarger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2\nare also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease\ncleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the\nviral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across\nthe two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or\naltered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for\nvirus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of\nnon-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.\nThese changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its\nability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.\n"	2014-12-12T16:15:49Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4034v1
2020-04-15	'Assessment of the MERS-CoV epidemic situation in the Middle East region'	'  The appearance of a novel coronavirus named Middle East (ME) Respiratory\nSyndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has raised global public health concerns\nregarding the current situation and its future evolution. Here we propose an\nintegrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region\nand importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of\nsporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model\nintegrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the\nzoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood\nestimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic\n(R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI\n0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region\nappear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with\npossible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in\nthe range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of\nflight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of\nimportation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security,\nthis analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates,\nsuggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for\nincreased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.\n'	2014-05-05T08:35:25Z	None	http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1481v2
